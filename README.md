## System Implementation
Describe the details of your implementations. Did you run into problems in your implementation? How did you overcome those problems?

## Computational Complexity
Must answer the following.

What is the computational complexity of the algorithm you used to find the shortest path between cities? How did you determine this complexity? Please justify why this algorithm and its complexity are acceptable given the criteria of the problem.

## Results
Did your results match the output in the “sampleresults.txt” file?
What are your answers to the following questions:
The shortest distance and path from FI to GG - The shortest distance from IRWIN to GRPVE is 24 through the route: IRWIN->PARKER->GRPVE
The shortest distance and path from PD to PM - The shortest distance from PARKER to POMONA is 133 through the route: PARKER->BOSSTOWN->TORRANCE->POMONA
The shortest distance and path from PM to PD - The shortest distance from POMONA to PARKER is 357 through the route: POMONA->EDWIN->ANAHEIM->VICTORVILLE->CHINO->GRPVE->IRWIN->PARKER
The Shortest distance and path from SB to PR - The shortest distance from BERNADINO to RIVERA is 152 through the route: BERNADINO->ISABELLA->BREA->CHINO->RIVERA

## Conclusion
Did your results match the output of the test program? Did you run into problems in your implementation? How did you overcome those problems?
